# StudentManagementSystem

- Developed a Student Management System to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records via RESTful APIs.

- Implemented the backend using Spring Boot Framework for modular development and efficient REST API handling.

- Utilized Spring Data JPA (Hibernate) for seamless communication between the Java application and the PostgreSQL database.

- Designed and configured API endpoints for student registration, updates, retrieval, and deletion using Spring MVC architecture.

- Tested and validated API endpoints using Postman, ensuring reliable data transfer and backend stability.

- Managed project dependencies and build automation using Maven, ensuring a clean and maintainable structure.

- Followed industry-standard coding practices and implemented layered architecture for scalability and clarity.

- Enhanced understanding of Java backend development, database integration, and API testing workflows.
